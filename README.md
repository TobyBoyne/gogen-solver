# gogen-solver
Finds the solution to a [Gogen](http://www.puzzles.grosse.is-a-geek.com/ubergogen.html) puzzle.

## Usage
To run the solver, run the `ui.py` module. In the tkinter window that opens, enter the known letter values, and the comma-separated word list. For an example grid, word list, and solution, see `test_board.py`.    
Some more complex puzzles cannot be solved. If this is the case, or not enough information is provided to find a solution, an error will be raised.

## Skills
- Create workflow to implement continuous integration testing in GitHub
- Use Tkinter to create a user interface
- Use numpy array operations (such as logical and/or, argwhere) to create efficient algorithms without needing to define unnecessary custom classes
